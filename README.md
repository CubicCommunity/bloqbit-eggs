### Hardware
Here are the minimal optimal specifications to allocate to your server instance running Bloqbit.

| Component | Specification            |
| :-------: | ------------------------ |
|  **CPU**  | 2 cores (multi-threaded) |
|  **RAM**  | 2 GB DDR4                |
| **Disk**  | 500 MB                   |
|  **OS**   | Linux-based System       |

> [!NOTE]
> These are the **minimal** specifications recommended when running Bloqbit on your server. These will likely need significant increases depending on how many servers your bot client is in and how active they are. Currently, we do not have more details on required hardware - we'll add more as we further test the bot!
